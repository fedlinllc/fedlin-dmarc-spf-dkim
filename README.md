# FEDLIN â€“ DMARC / SPF / DKIM

**Security Solutions Architecture Â· Vulnerability Management Â· Compliance Automation**

A customer-tenant-first email authentication service to get domains aligned to DMARC, SPF, and DKIM without exposing customer DNS, tenant names, or mail routing in the public repo. Designed for healthcare, professional services, and MSPs that need to harden mail but keep records in their own DNS.

---

## Who this is for

- Organizations that send business or clinical email from custom domains
- MSPs / MSSPs standardizing email auth across multiple customer tenants
- Regulated / PHI-adjacent orgs that must retain control of their DNS
- Subcontract/C2C work where the prime holds the customer relationship

---

## What it delivers

- DMARC policy design and rollout (p=none â†’ quarantine â†’ reject)
- SPF review and consolidation
- DKIM enablement/rotation guidance
- Reporting/forensic setup options that stay in **customer** infrastructure
- GitHub Actions (OIDC-only) delivery patterns for repeatable changes

> **Public repo policy:** This repository describes the service and delivery pattern. It does **not** contain real customer domains, DNS zones, or TXT records. All examples will use placeholders (e.g. `example.com`, `mail.example.com`).

---

## Evidence model (customer-owned)

- DNS changes are applied in **the customerâ€™s DNS / tenant**
- Evidence of correct policy is collected from customer-side tooling
- FEDLIN can supply automation via **GitHub Actions with OIDC only**
- Keeps MSP / subcontract deliveries clean for auditors and customers

---

## Delivery method

- **Primary:** GitHub Actions with OIDC-only
- **Options:** Terraform / policy-as-code / bash / python where DNS APIs are available
- **Engagement model:** Independent / C2C, subcontract-ready, MSP-friendly

---

## Deployment assets

Deployment assets (per-domain runbooks, DNS API configs, workflow files, redacted customer notes) are kept in the **private** repository:

ðŸ‘‰ **`fedlin-dmarc-spf-dkim-deployment`**

This public repo tracks the service description, not the customer code.
